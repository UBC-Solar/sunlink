# UBC Solar's Sunlink Brief Overview

Welcome to UBC Solar's telemetry aggregation, storage, and visualization system, Sunlink. This guide will cover the **most important aspects** of running the system. Please see the `docs` folder for more detailed information. *For example, There may be links in this guide referring to information inside a doc within the `docs` folder*.

## Need Help Running Sunlink?
### Commands
**Recommended Everytime you Open Sunlink**
```bash
git pull
sudo docker compose restart
```

**MUST Run Once in Sunlink directory**
```bash
source  environment/bin/activate
```
This will activate the virtual environment that has the Python packages to run our system installed.

| `./link_telemetry.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 921600 --prod --batch-size 2000 --local`     | **Useful at COMP!**: (Before reading, see [Sunlink Radio Pre-requistes](#can-setup-windows)). Uses radio (serial port) and does all parsing locally. Write to the "CAN_prod" bucket on InfluxDB.                                                                                             |
| `./link_telemetry.py -o --prod --batch-size 4000 --local`     | **Useful for BMS**: (Before reading, see [Sunlink CAN Pre-requistes](#can-setup-on-native-linux)). Uses CAN (-o) and does parsing locally instead of a docker container for increased speed. Set the batch size to 2x the typical data rate in seconds. To find the data rate, look at the yellow output when you run `./link_telemetry.py` and ballpark the number of messages processed every second. Writes to CAN_prod.                                                                                                 |        
| `./link_telemetry.py -r --debug -f 200 --batch-size 400 --local`     | **Useful for Testing**: Uses random message generation and does all parsing locally. Write to the "CAN_test" bucket on InfluxDB.

| `RTNETLINK answers: Device or resource busy`    | Restart CAN peripheral by unplugging the PCAN and plugging it back in. [Then run the commands here.](#can-setup-on-native-linux).                                                                                             |


### CAN Setup on Native Linux
Organized by command then explanation.
#### Commands
```bash
sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000
sudo ip link set can0 up
```
**Optionally to dump/print out CAN messages**
```bash
candump -td -H -x -c can0
```
#### Explanation
Your native Linux computer probably already has drivers for CAN installed, **but you need to setup the Peak-Systems USB-CAN reader on the computer**. 
1. First command sets up the virtual CAN peripheral on your computer. the `type can` tells the software that this is a CAN device. The `bitrate 500000` sets the bitrate to 500kHz, which **is what Solar standardly uses**.
2. The second command sets the virtual CAN peripheral to be "up" or active. **At this point you should see the PCAN blinking slowly. If CAN is being sent then the LED blinks fast**
3. The third command is optional and will print out the CAN messages that are being sent to the computer. This is useful for debugging and testing purposes. The `-td` flag tells the software to print out the ***t**ime **d**elta*, `-H` tells it print hardware (PCAN) timestamps instead of your computer's timestamp format, `-x` tells it print extra info like Rx/Tx (Was the CAN message going into your computer or out), and `-c` is the basic color mode level (you see a nice blue when you dump).

### CAN Setup Windows
Super easy, just download the [driver setup application Peak-Systems provides for windows](https://www.peak-system.com/quick/DrvSetup).

### Radio Setup on Native Linux
Already works out of the box. Use the `/dev/ttyUSB0` port. 

### Radio Setup on WSL
#### Commands
**Run as Administrator** Windows PowerShell. *Note: replace <BUSID> with the bus ID of the of **USB Serial Converter Device**
```powershell
winget install --interactive --exact dorssel.usbipd-win
usbipd list
usbipd bind --busid <BUSID>
usbipd attach --wsl --busid <BUSID>
```
Now open WSL and run the following commands:
```bash
sudo usermod -a -G tty $USER
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
```
#### Powershell Commands Explanation
1. The first command installs the USBIPD-WIN project which is required to connect USB devices to WSL2.
2. The second command lists all the connected USB devices. Look for the **Serial Converter Device**.
3. The third command binds a specific USB device. For the radio module's USB look for something that says **serial** in it.
4. The fourth command attaches the USB device to WSL2. This is required to access the USB device from WSL2.

#### WSL2 Commands Explanation
1. The first command adds your WSL2 user to the `tty` group. This is required to access the serial port.
2. The second command adds your WSL2 user to the `dialout` group. This is required to access the serial port.
3. The third command restarts WSL2. This is required to apply the changes made in the previous two commands.
