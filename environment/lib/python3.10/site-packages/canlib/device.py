class _Libs:
    """Class to facilitate importing canlib modules on-demand

    The main problem this class solves is that kvrlib is not available on
    linux, so unconditionally importing kvrlib is not an option. However, it is
    also preferable that simply importing this module loads most of pycanlib,
    if a user wants to use `Device` to interact with canlib, they should not
    need to load e.g. kvmlib.

    This class is instanced, once, in device.py as `_libs`. Any time a library,
    for example `canlib`, is used in device.py it will be accessed with
    ``_libs.canlib``. The first time this happens, there will be no ``canlib``
    attribute on ``libs``, and `_Libs.__getattr__` will be called. This looks
    up the library name provided in `_Libs._imports`, which should give a
    no-argument function that imports that library and returns
    it. `_Libs.__getattr__` then saves the returned module as an attribute,
    making sure that `_Libs.__getattr__` is only called the first time any
    particular library is requested.

class Device:
    """Class for keeping track of a physical device

    This class represents a physical device regardless of whether it is
    currently connected or not, and on which channel it is connected.

    If the device is currently connected, `Device.find` can be used to get a
    `Device` object::

        dev = Device.find(ean=EAN('67890-1'))

    `Device.find` supports searching for devices based on a variety of
    information, and will return a `Device` object corresponding to the first
    physical device that matched its arguments. In this case, it would be the
    first device found with an EAN of 73-30130-67890-1.

    If the device wanted is not currently connected, `Device` objects can be
    created with their EAN and serial number (as this is the minimal
    information needed to uniquely identify a specific device)::

        dev = Device(ean=EAN('67890-1'), serial=42)

    Two `Device` objects can be checked for equality (whether they refer to the same
    device) and be converted to a `str`. `Device.probe_info` can also be used
    for a more verbose string representation that queries the device (if
    connected) for various pieces of information.

    This class also provides functions for creating the other objects of `canlib`:

    * `canlib.Channel` -- `Device.channel`
    * `canlib.ChannelData` -- `Device.channel_data`
    * `canlib.IOControl` -- `Device.iocontrol`
    * `kvmlib.Memorator`-- `Device.memorator`
    * `linlib.Channel` -- `Device.lin_master` and `Device.lin_slave`

    Args:
        ean (`canlib.EAN`): The EAN of this device.
        serial (`int`): The serial number of this device.
        last_channel_number (`int`): The channel number this device was last
            found on (used as an optimization; while the device stays on the
            same CANlib channel there is no need for a linear search of all
