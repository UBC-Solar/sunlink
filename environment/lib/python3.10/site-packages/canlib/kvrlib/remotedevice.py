    Once this is done, the currently active profile can be accessed::

        active = rdev.active_profile

    All profiles, including the active one, are `ConfigProfile`
    objects, see that documentation for all the operations available for
    profile objects.

    The full list of profiles a device has can be inspected using
    ``rdev.profiles``. This is a `RemoteDevice.ProfileList` object, which works
    much like a list::

        # The profile list can be indexed
        first = rdev.profiles[0]

        # We can check if a configuration belongs to this device with 'in'

        # But negative indexes also work and are a better way of getting
        # the last profile

        # You can also iterate over all profiles

    `RemoteDevice` also lets you access a variety of information about the
    specific device, as well as the ability to do a WLAN scan with
    `RemoteDevice.wlan_scan`.

    If the device is password protected, that password can be passed to
    `openDevice`::

        protected_device = kvrlib.openDevice(0, password="Once upon a playground rainy")

    After the object is created, the password is available as::

        password = protected_device.password

    The password can be changed with::

        protected_device.password = "Wolves without teeth"

    The reason the password is stored as clear-text is because it must be
    supplied to the underlying library each time an operation is done using
    this and related classes. This also means that the password is only
    validated, and required, when one of the functions requiring a password is
    called.

    If the device is not password-protected, the password should be an empty string::

        unprotected_device = kvrlib.openDevice(1)
        assert unprotected_device.password == ''

    Wlan scans are automatically closed when garbage-collected, but they
    can also be closed manually with `WlanScan.close`.
