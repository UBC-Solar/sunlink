    This class has all the functionality available even when the log area has
    not been mounted -- this functionality is still present after the log area
    has been mounted (or if the area is always mounted -- see `.Kmf`).

    The number of log files can be read as the ``len()`` of this object

    Once a `.Memorator` object has been mounted, its `log` attribute is set to
    an instance of this class. This is the preferred way of using this class.

    For `.Kmf` objects, the `log` attribute is always an instance of this class
    as they are by definition mounted.

    In the following examples ``container`` can be either a `.Memorator` object
    that has been mounted, or a `.Kmf` object.

    The files within the log can be accessed via indexing::

        container.log[index]

    or all files can be iterated over::

        for log_file in container.log:
            ...

    The log area can also be validated::

            container.log.validate()

    Also see the super class `.UnmountedLog` for functionality this class has
    inherited.
