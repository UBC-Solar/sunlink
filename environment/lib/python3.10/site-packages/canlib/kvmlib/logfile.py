class LogFile:
    """A log file read from a `MountedLog` object

    This class is normally not directly instantiated but retrieved from a
    `MountedLog` object.

    The most common use of this class is iterating through it to get the
    individual events as `LogEvent` subclasses::

        for event in logfile:
            ...

    Note:

        While iterating over a `LogFile`, accessing any other `LogFile` is will
        result in a `LockedLogError`. Make sure to finish the loop (or when
        using iteration objects directly call the `close` method) before
        interacting with any other log files.

    A fast approximation of the number of events is given by
    `event_count_estimation`, the exact number of events can be calculated
    using::

        num_events = len(list(logfile))

    Finally this class has several read-only properties for getting information
    about the log file itself.

    Note:
        Before any data is fetched from the dll, this class will make sure that
        the correct file has been mounted on the underlying ``kvmHandle``.

        Manually mounting or unmounting log files by calling the dll directly
        is not supported.
