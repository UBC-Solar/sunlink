    canChannel has been renamed to Channel, using the old name (canChannel) is
    deprecated.

    Note that the CANLib class has also been deprecated, so instantiating a
    Channel object doesn't need a CANLib object as the first argument. To keep
    this class backwards compatible, the `canlib` argument when initializing
    `canChannel` objects is now ignored.

    See `canlib.CANLib` for more details about the deprecation.
