# Memorator Script Usage Guide
* Ensure that canlib is installed correctly. [**See this guide**](https://github.com/UBC-Solar/firmware_v3/tree/master/tools/t_programs/sendRTC).
* Ensure that you have the SD Card with the logged messages from the memorator
* Then plug in the SD Card into your device which is running sunlink
* Now, navigate to the `tools/` directory and then to the `MemoratorUploader.py` script. 
* Inside here you will need to change the `LOG_FOLDER` constant to the directory of the SD Card (directory that contains the `LOG000xx.KMF` files)
